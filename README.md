# TERRACE

This is a grid-based side-scrolling game that started out as a simple concept, but has since become a fully-fledged project of mine.

Let's be honest, I'm a programmer not an artist!

These graphics derive from some classic NES titles such as Mega Man (Capcom), Mario (Nintendo), and Sonic The Hedgehog (Sega).
I claim no ownership of these sprites and this game is not meant for commercial use.
It is merely a demonstration of my Java abilities.

### Map Editor

This game engine also includes an editor to create and modify map files that can be loaded into the game.
It can be found [here](https://github.com/jabes/terrace-editor).
